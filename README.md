# Breast Cancer Classification Model

This repository contains a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign using a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Dataset

The model uses the breast cancer dataset provided by scikit-learn. It includes information about various features of breast cancer tumors. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.


The script will train the Naive Bayes classifier, make predictions on the test set, and print the accuracy of the model.

## Results

The accuracy of the model on the test set is printed in the console. This metric provides an indication of how well the model is performing in classifying breast cancer tumors.
